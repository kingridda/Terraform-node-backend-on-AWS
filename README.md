# Terraform: deploy NestJS app on EC2 RDS ELB

Demonstrations using Terraform: deployment of a NestJS app with EC2, RDS database and Loadbalancers.

NestJS is a Framework for node.js Backend. The NestJS Framework is prefered by me :p for many reasons over Express and other Frameworks.

PS: the tutorial is valid Express and other Backend Frameworks as well, tune the steps as you please.
